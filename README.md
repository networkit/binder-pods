## 
This is an accompanying repository for [NetworKit](https://github.com/networkit/networkit), containing binder Dockerfiles of NetworKit-bundles. These bundles include certain configurations (normally older or non-released versions) and Jupyter-notebooks from events, conferences or published research-data. To access a bundle go to any branch except "master" and click on the binder-button in the description.
